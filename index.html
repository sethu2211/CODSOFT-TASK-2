        <p class="project-details">
            This project presents a sophisticated smart door lock system that integrates fingerprint verification and Bluetooth control for enhanced security and convenience. Users can enroll their fingerprints, which are stored securely, allowing seamless access upon verification. The system is remotely manageable via Bluetooth, enabling users to lock and unlock the door with voice commands. The project also features a web interface to monitor and control the system, along with data storage and retrieval capabilities. Through a harmonious integration of hardware and software components, this project offers a seamless and advanced solution for modern security needs.

        <h3 class="project-title">MACHINE LEARNING - Improvised Naive Bayes</h3>
        <p class="project-details">
            The problem addressed in this study is the prediction of admission status for new students at Matana University using machine learning algorithms. The dataset consists of several features such as frequency, JaBoDeTaBek, major study program, and admission status. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify new students into different admission status categories based on the given features.
            Initially, a Naive Bayes algorithm was employed to tackle the problem. However, due to the desire for improved efficiency further modifications were made to the Naive Bayes algorithm, to enhance its performance. The improved Naive Bayes classifier showed enhanced accuracy, precision, recall, and F1- score compared to the original implementation.

        <h3 class="project-title">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE - Fruit & Vegetable recognition</h3>
        <p class="project-details">
            This project presents an image recognition system for classifying fruits and vegetables based on an input array using AI with Python. The system uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transfer Learning techniques to classify images of fruits and vegetables based on their visual features, such as shape, color, and texture. The input array consists of different attributes of fruits and vegetables, such as weight, size, color, and texture. The proposed system's accuracy is evaluated using standard evaluation metrics, such as Precision, Recall. The results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves high accuracy in identifying different types of fruits and vegetables based on their input array. This approach can be useful in various applications, such as online grocery shopping, where customers can upload an image and input array to identify fruits and vegetables accurately.
